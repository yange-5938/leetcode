# Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head. You must solve the problem without modifying the values in the list's nodes (i.e., only nodes themselves may be changed.)

 

# Example 1:


# Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
# Output: [2,1,4,3]
# Example 2:

# Input: head = []
# Output: []


# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def swapPairs(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        dummy = ListNode(0)
        dummy.next = head
        current = dummy

        while current.next and current.next.next:
            first = current.next
            second = current.next.next

            first.next = second.next
            second.next = first
            current.next = second

            current = current.next.next

    
        return dummy.next

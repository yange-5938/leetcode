Leetcode Journey starting from 05.Oct.2023

My leetcode profile: [leetcode.com/Yange_9234/](https://leetcode.com/Yange_9234/)

## Why?

Because I need to practice my programming skill, leetcode is perhaps the most efficient way to do so that I can think of. I'm tired of knowing these big theories but having trouble to make things work.

## Language and why?

C++. Because Python can get away without knowing some big important stuff e.g. pointers, memory allocation etc. and Java has JVM which in my opnion it's too powerful and allows some level of skipping.

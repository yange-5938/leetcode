Leetcode Journey

My leetcode profile: [leetcode.com/Yange_9234/](https://leetcode.com/Yange_9234/)

## Why?

~~10.2023~~
~~Because I need to practice my programming skill, leetcode is perhaps the most efficient way to do so.~~

~~02.2024~~
~~Get better at coding, prepare for interviews.~~

05.2024
I don't get to code enough algorithms anywhere else. At work, my tasks are often limited to writing business logic code, using some frameworks, or fixing bugs. LeetCode may be the only place where I can systematically solve algorithmic coding questions.

## Language and why?

~~10.2023~~
~~C++, doing C++ to get to know more about pointers, memory management, metaprogramming etc.~~

~~12.2023~~
~~C++ and Python, learn two languages at once, as both are highly demanded languages in different domains.~~

~~02.2024~~
~~Python, fastest to write, most concise to read, made for interviews.~~

04.2024 
Python for less boilerplates, and i'm starting to practicte SQL as well now.

## Thoughts

05.2024
+ I think it makes more sense to have questions solved in same categroy rather than scatter them in different categories.
+ Rather than "thinking by myself", I will directly look into the solutions and replicate the solution. It's more efficient for me to learn from bursting the question quantity

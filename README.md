Leetcode Journey starting from 05.Oct.2023

My leetcode profile: [leetcode.com/Yange_9234/](https://leetcode.com/Yange_9234/)

## Why?

Because I need to practice my programming skill, leetcode is perhaps the most efficient way to do so that I can think of.

## Language and why?

C++. Because Python can get away without knowing some important stuff e.g. pointers, memory allocation etc. and Java has JVM which is also too powerful and allows some level of skipping.

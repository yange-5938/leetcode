Leetcode Journey

My leetcode profile: [leetcode.com/Yange_9234/](https://leetcode.com/Yange_9234/)

## Why?

~~10.2023~~
~~Because I need to practice my programming skill, leetcode is perhaps the most efficient way to do so.~~

~~02.2024~~
~~Get better at coding, prepare for interviews.~~

05.2024
I don't get enough code implementation anywhere else, in work my tasks are often just to use some framework, or fix some little bugs. Leetcode could be only place I can sysmtematically solving some coding questions.



## Language and why?

~~10.2023~~
~~C++, doing C++ to get to know more about pointers, memory management, metaprogramming etc.~~

~~12.2023~~
~~C++ and Python, learn two languages at once, as both are highly demanded languages in different domains.~~

02.2024
Python, fastest to write, most concise to read, made for interviews.

## Thoughts

05.2024
+ I think it makes more sense to have questions solved in same categroy rather than scatter them in different categories.
+ Rather than "thinking by myself", I will directly look into the solutions and replicate the solution. It's more efficient for me to learn from bursting the question quantity
